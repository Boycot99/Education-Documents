Entity Data Model(EDM)
Entity Provider
{
 readMetadata(content
}

For read of a complete ODataFeed the HTTP GET request URI is a EntitySet. 
Via the connect(...) method the request is done against the created absolut uri and the responding content is returned as InputStream.
 This InputStream than will be de-serialized by the EntitProvider.readFeed(...) into an ODataFeed object which 
 contains all entities provided by the OData Service as well as FeedMetadata like inline count and next link.
