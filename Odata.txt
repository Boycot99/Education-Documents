Entity Data Model(EDM)
Entity Provider
{
 readMetadata(content
}

For read of a complete ODataFeed the HTTP GET request URI is a EntitySet. 
Via the connect(...) method the request is done against the created absolut uri and the responding content is returned as InputStream.
 This InputStream than will be de-serialized by the EntitProvider.readFeed(...) into an ODataFeed object which 
 contains all entities provided by the OData Service as well as FeedMetadata like inline count and next link.
 
 
Code sample: Read EDM ($metadata)
 Read single Entry or  Read complete Feed
 
 
 Code sample: Create single Entry
  POST entry
   Read response
   Create single Entry method
   _________________________________________________________
   Entity is a instance of Entity Types. 
   Entity Type is a structed records which consisting of named and typed properties and with a key.
   Complex types it's the same, but without a key, so Complex Type can only exist as a property of a containing entity or a temporary value.
   A Entity Key is formed from  a subset of properties of the Entity Type.
   Therefore, Entity Key is a central concept for uniquely of Entity Types and allowing to Entity Type instances to participate in relationships.
   Entities are grouped to Entity Set.
   Associations define the relationships between two or more entity types. Instances Of Associations are grouped to Association Set.
   Navigation Properties are special property on Entity Types which are bound to a specific association and can be used to refer to association of an entity.
	Finally all instance containers(Entity set and Association Set) are grouped in Entity Container.
	In OData Service terms: The feed exposed by an Odata service represented by Entity Set or a Navigation Property on an Entity that identifies a collection of Entity.
